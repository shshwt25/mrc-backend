Severe damage to most catecholaminergic-containing nerve cells in the brain stem is a characteristic pathological finding, although damage if not restricted to these structures. Genetic studies have shown that several mutations, including mutations in alpha-synuclein and DJ-1, are associated with parkinsonism. These genes and gene products have been studied as biomarkers for PD. The potential role of alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PD was explored through molecular genetic studies that identified PD-associated mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene as well as identification of alpha-synuclein as a major component in Lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark of the disease alpha-synuclein was identified both in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CSF concentrations of alpha-synuclein were studied in 33 patients with idiopathic PD and in 38 neurological control subjects (Toduka, et al, 2006). Reduced levels of alpha-synuclein in the cerebrospinal fluid of aged subjects and a greater reduction of alpha-synuclein in those subjects with Parkinson\u2019s Disease were observed. Further studies were performed using an ELISA with improved sensitivity (Mollenhauer et al., 2008). This was a cross-sectional study of 100 CSF donors with advanced PD, dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer disease, and non- neurodegenerative disease controls.

These studies demonstrated that significantly elevated levels of oligomeric forms of alpha-synuclein in plasma were obtained from 34 PD patients compared with 27 controls. PD is characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. DJ-1 is an antioxidant protein whose loss of function by gene mutation has been linked to familial PD. Although the mechanism of by which dopaminergic neurons are selectively damaged in PD remains unclear, evidence suggests that oxidative stress may play a major role in the pathogenesis (Abou-Sleiman, at al, 2006; Hashimoto, et al., 2003). In order to determine if DJ-1 was involved in sporadic PD, quantitative immunoblot assays were performed to determine DJ-1 levels in CSF from sporadic PD patients and non-PD controls (Waragai, et al. 2006). These results showed that DJ-1 concentrations in the CSF from PD were significantly higher than those in non-PD controls. In addition, upregulation of DJ-1 in the early stage of PD was greater than that in the advanced stage and in non-PD controls. In addition, DJ-1 levels have been studied in the plasma of sporadic PD patients, dementia with Lewy body patients and healthy age-matched controls (Waragai, et al., 2007). Plasma DJ-1 levels in PD were higher than those in control. Moreover, plasma DJ-1 levels were in the advanced stage of PD were higher than those in the early stage of PD.
